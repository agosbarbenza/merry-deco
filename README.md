# Welcome to Merry Deco

## About me

Hi! My name is Agostina Barbenza, I'm 28 years old and I'm a fullstack developer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm also a Programming student from Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional - Facultad Regional Avellaneda (UTN - FRA).
I've been working as an Application Developer in Accenture Argentina since 2020 and after one year developing projects with React, I decided to take Coderhouse's React JS course in order to acquire more knowledge and deepen concepts in this powerful technology.

## About the project

This is the front-end of an ecommerce site dedicated to selling Christmas stuff. You can see the list of products by different categories, add or remove as many products as you like (based on a stock) from your cart and then finish the purchase by creating an order, which will be stored in Firebase.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
